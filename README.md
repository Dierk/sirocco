Frege database experiments based on project: https://github.com/DellCliff/frege-dbc

The `sirocco-samples` project mixes `frege-dbc` with `chinook` to show
how a full Frege app may look like. To run the app, on the project root folder:

    ./gradlew :sirocco-samples:run

Or to only play with the code:

    ./gradlew :sirocco-samples:fregeRepl
